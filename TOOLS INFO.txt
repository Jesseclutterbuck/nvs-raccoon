The NVS Raccoon project is a on going project of mine which i plan to upgrade regularly. The final outcome 
being a large collection of python scrips that may be useful to operating systems such as Kali Linux and Parrot Security o.s.
All scrips are written in python 2.7.0 opposed to python 3.9.0 to allow the script to run natively. And each script is separate alowing the script to run 
with out needing to rely on another.All scripts are compatible with all versions of Kali Linux.
